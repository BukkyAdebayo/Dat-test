# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Final Project, Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Overview

Exploratory data analysis is a crucial and informative step in the data process, as it helps confirm or deny your initial hypotheses from the original problem scope, and helps visualize the positive and negative relationships your data has. It can also help inform data transformations that need to occur in order to optimize the machine learning approach that will come.

Your exploratory data analysis will effectively help you tell your data's story, and should help inform the predictive analytics process that your project will take.

#### Requirements

Through this process, you will:

* Review the data set and project with an EIR during office hours.
* Practice importing (potentially unformatted) data into clean matrices|data frames, and if necessary, exports into a form that makes sense (text files or a database, for example).
* Explore the mathematical properties and visualize data through the means of a python visualization tool (matplotlib and seaborn)
* Provide insight about the data set and any impact on a hypothesis.

**Bonus:**

- Surface and share your analysis online. Jupyter makes this very simple and the setup should not take long.
- Try experimenting with other visualization languages; python/pandas-highcharts, shiny/r, or for a real challenge, d3 on its own. Interactive data analysis opens the doors for others to easily interpret your work and explore the data themselves!

---

#### Necessary Deliverables

* A well organized Jupyter notebook with code and output
* At least one visual for each independent variable and, if possible, its relationship to your dependent variable.
    * It's just as important to show what's not correlated as it is to show the real correlations found
    * Visuals should be well labeled and intuitive based on the data types. For example, if your X variable is temperature and y is "did it rain," a reasonable visual would be two histograms of temperature, one where it did rain, and one where it did not.
    * Tables are a perfectly valid visualization tool! Interweave them into your work.

#### Starter code

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- keep the project simple! the "cool" part of the analysis will come, but just looking at some simple relationships between variables can be incredibly insightful
- consider building some helper functions that help you quickly visualize and interpret data. EDA should be formulaic, the code should not be holding you back. There are plenty of "starter code" examples from class materials.
- If you see yourself copy and pasting code a lot, turn it into a function, and use the function instead

#### Deliverable

This deliverable should be very similar to the EDA project completed earlier during the course.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Base on the requirements you can earn a maximum of _____ points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!


### TIMELINE

### EVALUATION
**Guidelines & Rubric** 
Your project will be evaluated by your instructors in the following areas:

1. Identify
2. Acquire
3. Present

**Rubric**: [Link to rubric](#). Based on the requirements, you can earn a maximum of 9 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While the overall rubric will serve as a helpful gauge of whether you met project goals, your __specific scores are more important__ since they can help you identify where to focus your efforts in the future!
