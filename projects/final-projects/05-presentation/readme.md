# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Final Project, Part 5: Final Presentation

#### Overview

This is it! This presentation is amassed to show what you've learned through this course to a "non data science" audience. It is very common in both interviews and in the job to be presenting your findings and work to business partners or other interested parties that don't know anything about data science, therefore; it's important to communicate effectively your work in a way that anyone can understand.

The output here will be a 10 minute presentation that guides your viewers through the problem, original data and hypothesis, findings, and results; very similar to the outline and work that you've output over the last few weeks. In fact, much of this presentation is done; time to clean up your output!

In response, you'll participate in a short Q/A session (roughly two minutes) with your peers--both fellow students and instructors--about your project.

#### Requirements

Through this process, you will:

* Show off your work to what would be a less technical, more business oriented audience
* Summarize the work you've completed from earlier deliverables into a clean, deck-based presentation
* Review next steps with the audience in a deployment scenario: how do you take this project beyond the scope of this course?

This includes a presentation that reviews:

* Your project's background, problem and hypothesis
* the datasets you used and a brief description of them
* data exploration through summary and charts
* an explanation of your model (think explain like I'm 5)
* recommendations based on findings; deployment of model; next steps
* an appendix that includes the more technical terminology and work

#### Necessary Deliverables

A 10 to 20 slide deck. The breakdown should look relatively similar to what follows. Attached to each are questions to ask yourself in order to make sure the deck does as is needed. It may be even more helpful to go over this with a friend or family member: see if they can answer the questions by going through your presentation.

* 1 slide that covers an outline of what you're talking about
    - What is your project about?
    - What is its history?
    - What relevant information is required for a colleague to jump in to understand your project?
* 2-3 slides as a summary of the project, including data and problem statement
    - what were you trying to accomplish?
    - what steps did your project take?
    - where did the data come from? public source? work? what does a sample look like? was there data you considered to use but decided to remove?
* 3-4 slides that show off insights that helped suggest the modeling approach (no more than two visuals per slide; keep it simple!)
    - what is the visualization explaining?
    - what do the x and y axes mean?
    - how does the visualization help either prove or disprove your work?
    - what caveats have to be explained to best understand it?
* iterations of:
    * 2-3 slides that explain the modeling approach itself
    * 2-3 slides that explain how the modeling went
        - what was your model trying to optimize for? why was it the right metric for optimization?
        - what algorithm did you try? how does it work?
        - what worked / what didn't? why do you think so?
* 1-2 slides on conclusions
    - what had the most impact on your work?
    - what can you confirm? what can you suggest? what is still to be determined? (be careful here! rarely do mathematicians ever say their theories prove anything)
* 1-2 slides on next steps
    - what will this project do moving forward?
    - what would be the next two or three things you want to try? what kind of impact do you think they'd make?
    - what do your conclusions enable others to do?
* slides for acknowledgments!

#### Starter code

Refer to the presentation template as a blueprint for how to organize your work.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- As mentioned, the majority of your content is already available. A quick text outline of "what do I need" and "where is it currently" can help you identify the gaps in your presentation.
- This presentation will be stored as a pdf, so treat it like so. Think less about fancy powerpoint transitions, etc; the most successful presentations had a clean, black font on a white background.
- Make sure all of your charts are very clear and labeled. If the chart is unreadable, it will make it harder for people to understand. Keep the charts simple.

- Presentations from (PyData)[http://www.slideshare.net/PyData/presentations]
- Presentations from (DataGotham)[https://www.youtube.com/user/DataGotham]), a shortly-ran data conference in NYC.
- (Seaborn)[https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/aesthetics.html#scaling-plot-elements-with-plotting-context-and-set-context] has a handy easy way to set figures into a "talk" context, which blows up the text and makes it easier to read.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Base on the requirements you can earn a maximum of _____ points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!


### TIMELINE

### EVALUATION
**Guidelines & Rubric** 
Your project will be evaluated by your instructors in the following areas:

1. Identify
2. Acquire
3. Present

**Rubric**: [Link to rubric](#). Based on the requirements, you can earn a maximum of 9 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While the overall rubric will serve as a helpful gauge of whether you met project goals, your __specific scores are more important__ since they can help you identify where to focus your efforts in the future!
