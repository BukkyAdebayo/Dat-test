#### Overview

In the field of data science, projects are practical; they relate to your working domain and require an understanding of scope.  Sometimes, your ideas approaching a project could use a reality check.

For part one of your final project, you will come up with a few different ideas around potential problems you can solve with data and present them in small groups in class. You'll get the opportunity to get some quick feedback from your peers and the instructional team that should give you direction for your final project.  Keep in mind that it's important to run though this ideation process a few times to generate clarity around what your project could look like with different interests.

#### Requirements

Your presentation must:

* Explain three potential projects that include: a problem statement, a hypothesis, and potential data sets
* Be 2-3 minutes in duration
* Show you have spent time familiarizing yourself with the domain of the data, if you aren't already familiar

**Bonus:**

- High level data points can help show the "improvement" scope that's available
- Cite similar/previous work that will better inform your strategy that can be taken

---

#### Necessary Deliverables

You should present from a prepared deck that explains the following:

* **The Problem** What's the background and scope of the project idea? What problem are you attempting to address or solve? Who may it matter to?
* **Data** What data exists to help solve this problem? Where is it coming from? What does the data look like? What is the observation?
* **Hypotheses** Given the problem and data you're aware of, what do you believe is the solution? What does success look like?

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Try putting together a three-slide deck, for each of your project ideas, to keep organized
- Look for example (or real) data to get a feel for what information exists for you to use
- Think about how much time you can dedicate to the project each week, and where you think the largest challenges will lie
- Think about this as an elevator pitch: be prepared, do some light research, but don't go down any "rabbit holes

### Useful Resources

- For overall project ideas, consider looking at former [General Assembly Data Science Projects](https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/DS?metro=)

#### Example Deliverable

Take a look at the [sample deck](#) provided.  There are three slides, corresponding to three potential project ideas, and al include a problem, hypothesis, and potential data sets.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Base on the requirements, you can earn a maximum of 9 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a gauge of whether you met the project goals and can help you identify where to focus your efforts moving forward!
