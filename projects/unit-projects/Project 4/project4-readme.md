### EVALUATION
**Guidelines & Rubric** 

Your project will be evaluated by your instructors in the following areas:

1. Guiding Principle / Technical Requirement 1
2. Guiding Principle/ Technical Requirement 2
3. Guiding Principle/ Technical Requirement 3

#### Rubric: [Link to rubric](#). 

Based on the requirements, you can earn a maximum of _____ points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While the overall rubric will serve as a helpful gauge of whether you met project goals, your __specific scores are more important__ since they can help you identify where to focus your efforts in the future!

### RESOURCES
**Examples & Suggestions**

#### Dataset  
We'll be using the same dataset as UCLA's Logit Regression in R tutorial to explore logistic regression in Python. Our goal will be to identify the various factors that may influence admission into graduate school. It containes four variables- admit, gre, gpa, rank.

- admit- is a binary variable. It indicates whether or not a candidate was admitted admit =1) our not (admit= 0)
- gre- GRE score
- gpa- Grade Point Average
- rank- Rank of an applicant's undergraduate alma mater with 1 being a high rank and 4 being the lowest rank

#### Starter code
IPython Notebook with questions is provided. Check out the Example notebook.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started
- Review your previous work notebooks and the feedback.

#### Deliverable
Completed IPython Notebook

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation
Based on the requirements, you can earn a maximum of 3 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
