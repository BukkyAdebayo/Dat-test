#### Overview
In this project, you will perform a logistic regression on the admissions data we've been working with in projects 1 and 2.

---
#### Requirements
- Create dummy variables
- Calculate OR by hand
- Complete a logistic regression using stats models and interpret your findings
- Calculate predicted probabilities


**Bonus:**
- Plot the predicted portabilities
- Brainstorm ways to improve your analysis

---

#### Necessary Deliverables
- Completed IPython Notebook

---
#### Dataset  
We'll be using the same dataset as UCLA's Logit Regression in R tutorial to explore logistic regression in Python. Our goal will be to identify the various factors that may influence admission into graduate school. It contains four variables- admit, gre, gpa, rank.

- admit- is a binary variable. It indicates whether or not a candidate was admitted admit =1) our not (admit= 0)
- gre- GRE score
- gpa- Grade Point Average
- rank- Rank of an applicant's undergraduate alma mater with 1 being a high rank and 4 being the lowest rank


#### Starter code
IPython Notebook with questions is provided.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started
- Review logistic regression, odds ratios and probabilities from lecture
- **Read the docs for Stats models.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a data scientist!

### Useful Resources
- [Stats Models Docs](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/)

#### Deliverable
Completed IPython Notebook

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation
Based on the requirements, you can earn a maximum of 3 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
