### PROMPT
**Context & Takeaway:**

"A problem well-stated is half-solved" -- Charles Kettering

Welcome to Data Science! In this first project you will create a framework to scope out data science projects. This framework will provide you with a guide to develop a well-articulated problem statement and analysis plan that will be robust and reproducible.

### DELIVERABLES
**Project Requirements & Constraints**


#### Deliverable: Completed IPython Notebook using markup
**Breakdown:**
- Identify features of the dataset including the outcome, and covariates/predictors
- Create a data dictionary with classification of available variables
- Evaluate what makes a high quality problem statement
- Write a problem statement
- State the risks and assumptions of your data
- Outline exploratory analysis methods

**Bonus:**
- Practice writing an alternative problem statement for your dataset
- Brownie points for articulating the assumptions and risks of the alternative model

### EVALUATION
**Guidelines & Rubric** 

Your project will be evaluated by your instructors in the following areas:

1. Guiding Principle
2. Guiding Principle
3. Guiding Principle

#### Rubric:
Based on the requirements, you can earn a maximum of 3 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

### RESOURCES
**Examples & Suggestions**

#### Dataset  
We'll be using the same dataset as UCLA's Logit Regression in R tutorial to explore logistic regression in Python. Our goal will be to identify the various factors that may influence admission into graduate school. It contains four variables- admit, gre, gpa, rank.

- admit- is a binary variable. It indicates whether or not a candidate was admitted admit =1) our not (admit= 0)
- gre- GRE score
- gpa- Grade Point Average
- rank- Rank of an applicant's undergraduate alma mater with 1 being a high rank and 4 being the lowest rank

#### Starter code
For this project we will be using an IPython notebook. Notebooks are a handy way to communicate your research with your team and share your analysis. Using markup syntax will allow you create more visually appealing notebooks.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started
- Get used to the IPython Notebook. Play around with keyboard shortcuts.
- Try out basic markdown for commonly used formats; see cheat sheet-- headers, bold, italic, tables
- **Read the docs for IPython Notebooks.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a data scientist!

#### Links to Past Projects
Check out the example notebook below with a data dictionary and responses to questions. Wonder how to format your notebook the same way? Click on a section to see the markdown.
