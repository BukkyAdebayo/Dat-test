# Final Project: Lightning Talk

### Objectives

* Articulate a series of ideas around a problem statement, a hypothesis, and potential data sets.
* Gain insight and perspective in final project scope from peers

## Expectations

Due Date: Week 4

You will plan at least one "deck" that explains the following:

* **The Problem** What's the background and scope of the project idea? What problem are you attempting to address or solve? Who may it matter to?
* **Data** What data exists to help solve this problem? Where is it coming from? What does the data look like? What is the observation?
* **Hypotheses** Given the problem and data you're aware of, what do you believe is the solution? What does success look like?

_Ideally_ you should plan a couple of these: your first project idea may be your best, or not, and it's important to run though this process a few times to generate clarity around what the project could look like with different interests.

## Ideas for Class Activities

#### One and Done

Each student can share the project idea that they are attached to in front of the class. To keep the class moving, it'd be a better idea to leave all presentations onto _one_ computer or deck. Each student gets 60 seconds to talk through their idea, and then another 60 seconds are used for their classmates to submit feedback (via Google Form, markdown files, etc).

#### Small Group Share

Group students into small groups of 4-6. In each group, students walk through up to 2 different ideas that they have prepped, and get feedback from their peers. Each group submits their shared feedback. An extension would be to allow each group to pick one project/person to share in front of the whole class.
