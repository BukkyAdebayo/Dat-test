#### Overview

Typically in the realm of data science, projects do not come out of thin air; they relate to your domain and have a practicality to it, but require an understanding of scope and work, and sometimes, even just a reality check.

By organizing a few different ideas around potential data problems to work on, you'll get the opportunity to get some quick feedback from your peers and the instructors that'll help you decide what makes the most sense for you to work on for your final project.

#### Requirements

Your work must:

* Explain the problem statement, a hypothesis, and potential data sets.
* Show you have spent time familiarizing yourself with the domain of the data, if you aren't already familiar.

**Bonus:**

- Throwing together high level data points can help show the "improvement" scope that's available
- Being familiar with similar/previous work can better inform the strategy that can be taken

---

#### Necessary Deliverables

Plan "decks" that explains the following:

* **The Problem** What's the background and scope of the project idea? What problem are you attempting to address or solve? Who may it matter to?
* **Data** What data exists to help solve this problem? Where is it coming from? What does the data look like? What is the observation?
* **Hypotheses** Given the problem and data you're aware of, what do you believe is the solution? What does success look like?

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Even though this is not a real deck, it may help to put together a 3 slide deck to keep your ideas organized.
- Find example (or real) data so you already have an idea of what is potentially available.
- Think about how much time you can dedicate to the project each week, and where you think the largest challenges will lie.

### Useful Resources

- For overall project ideas, consider looking at former [General Assembly Data Science Projects](https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/DS?metro=)

#### Deliverable

Plan three "decks": your first project idea may be your best, or not, and it's important to run though this process a few times to generate clarity around what the project could look like with different interests.

Keep in mind, this is not a real deck. Think about it like an elevator pitch; be prepared, do some light research, but don't go down any rabbit holes.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Base on the requirements you can earn a maximum of _____ points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
