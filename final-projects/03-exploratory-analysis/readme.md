# Final Project, Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

### Objectives
* Review the data set and project with an EIR during office hours.
* Practice importing (potentially unformatted) data into clean matrices|data frames, and if necessary, exports into a form that makes sense (text files or a database, for example).
* Explore the mathematical properties and visualize data through the means of a python visualization tool (matplotlib and seaborn)
* Provide insight about the data set and any impact on a hypothesis.

### Necessary Deliverables

* Well organized Jupyter notebook with code and output, including visuals and tables showing data analysis.

### Going the Extra Mile

* Encourage students to publish their analysis online. Jupyter makes this very simple and the setup for students should not take long.
* Encourage more "engineering complete" students to experiment with other visualization tools; python/pandas-highcharts, shiny/r, or just straight up d3 for those who are interesting in the challenge. Keep in mind this should be an afterthought; students shouldn't get caught up in this process.
