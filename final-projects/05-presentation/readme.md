#### Overview

This is it! This presentation is amassed to show what you've learned through this course to a "non data science" audience. It is very common in both interviews and in the job to be presenting your findings and work to business partners or other interested parties that don't know anything about data science, therefore; it's important to communicate effectively your work in a way that anyone can understand.

The output here will be a 10 minute presentation that guides your viewers through the problem, original data and hypothesis, findings, and results; very similar to the outline and work that you've output over the last few weeks. In fact, much of this presentation is done; time to clean up your output!

#### Requirements

Through this process, you will:

* Show off your work to what would be a less technical, more business oriented audience
* Summarize the work you've completed from earlier deliverables into a clean, deck-based presentation
* Review next steps with the audience in a deployment scenario: how do you take this project beyond the scope of this course?

---

#### Necessary Deliverables

A 10 to 20 slide deck that reviews:

* Your project's background, problem and hypothesis
* the datasets you used and a brief description of them
* data exploration through summary and charts
* an explanation of your model (think explain like I'm 5)
* recommendations based on findings; deployment of model; next steps
* an appendix that includes the more technical terminology and work

#### Starter code

Refer to the presentation template as a blueprint for how to organize your work.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- As mentioned, the majority of your content is already available. A quick text outline of "what do I need" and "where is it currently" can help you identify the gaps in your presentation.
- This presentation will be stored as a pdf, so treat it like so. Think less about fancy powerpoint transitions, etc; the most successful presentations had a clean, black font on a white background.
- Make sure all of your charts are very clear and labeled. If the chart is unreadable, it will make it harder for people to understand. Keep the charts simple.

### Useful Resources

- Presentations from (PyData)[http://www.slideshare.net/PyData/presentations]
- Presentations from (DataGotham)[https://www.youtube.com/user/DataGotham]), a shortly-ran data conference in NYC.
- (Seaborn)[https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/aesthetics.html#scaling-plot-elements-with-plotting-context-and-set-context] has a handy easy way to set figures into a "talk" context, which blows up the text and makes it easier to read.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Base on the requirements you can earn a maximum of _____ points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
