#### Overview

Project outlines are a valuable resource to working through data projects. They help keep your project organized. Even if/as challenges come up with your project that may derail you away from your plan, as last you go in with a thoughtful approach. A well constructed outline can make the actual work of your project effortless; a poorly written outline could leave your mind wandering away from the goals, and of course, make the project take even more of your time.

You are expected to complete an outline for one of the three lightning talks you designed, which serves as the "real" starting point to getting your project off the ground. Realistically, you should aim to get this outline completed as soon as you have a clear idea which project from your lightning talks you want to work on, but at the latest, to submit it by week 7 of the course. Earlier completion of this task will allow for more chances to iterate and improve your project process.

#### Requirements

Your work must:

* Flesh out to a more complete scope one of your original project ideas
* Provide a sense of depth and scale to the project, which can be used to guide where the majority of your time should be spent working on the project.
* Show a clear connection between the datasets and the problem presented. The project should avoid working with independent variables (or features) that would not ordinarily be available in order to predict your target.

**Bonus:**

- Consider other hypotheses: if your project is a regression problem, is it possible to rewrite it as a classification problem?
- You can "convert" your goal metric from a statistical one (like Mean Squared Error) and tie it to something non-data people can understand, like a cost/benefit analysis

---

#### Necessary Deliverables

Your overview of approach will include:

* A more complete project problem and hypothesis based on your lightning talk
* Detailed explanation of data available (a data dictionary being the most specific approach; links to already built data dictionaries okay)
* Outstanding questions, assumptions, risks, caveats
* Domain knowledge included, knowledge about previous efforts/work. Including a benchmark if there is one
* Explaining what a success looks like

#### Starter code

Please use the [template](01-template.md) provided.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- The more time you spend researching, the less time you'll likely spend writing; this is a positive sign!
- While researching, keep track of all of your resources. Make sure they're trustworthy.
- If you've seen similar work online, see if you can find the code that implemented the data munging. It might come in handy!
- If your project requires using an API, make sure you can get access to it. Not everyone gives away API keys immediately, and you don't want to be caught with no data with one week left to work!

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Base on the requirements you can earn a maximum of _____ points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
