# Project Design Writeup and Approval

### Objectives

* Flesh out to a more complete scope one of your original project ideas
* Provide a sense of depth and scale to the project
* Plan ahead for EDA and modeling

## Expectations

Due Date: Weeks 5 - 7

Students are expected to have completed the outline template, which serves as a starting point to getting their project off the ground and to get feedback from instructors/EIRs. Realistically students should be completing this soon after their lightning talk, but at the latest should have it submitted by week 7. Feel free to work with students that submit earlier to allow them to iterate through this approach.

As shown in the template, the overview of approach will include:
* A more completely project problem and hypothesis
* Detailed explanation of data available (a data dictionary being the most specific approach; links to already built data dictionaries okay)
* Outstanding questions, assumptions, risks, caveats
* Domain knowledge included, knowledge about previous efforts/work. Including a benchmark if there is one
* Explaining what a success looks like
