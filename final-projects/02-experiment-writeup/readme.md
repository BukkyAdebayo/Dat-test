#### Overview

Project outlines are a valuable resource as you work through data projects because they help keep your project organized and provide direction. Even if/as challenges come throughout your project, those that may derail your plan, you will have a planned, thoughtful approach to fall back on. A well-constructed outline can make the execution of your project a lot easier and provide clear project goals saving you time as you execute.

For part two of your final project, you are expected to complete an outline for one of the three lightning talks you presented in class - this will serve as a "project kickoff" of sorts. Ideally, you should aim to get this outline completed as soon as you have a clear idea of which of your lightning talk ideas you'd want to work on.  At the very latest, this should be submitted during week 7 of the course, but keep in mind that the earlier this is completed, the more time you'll have to iterate and improve your project process, model, and final presentation.

#### Requirements

Your work must:

- Elaborate on your project problem and hypothesis including:
  - the problem you are solving
  - project scope
  - elaboration of machine learning aspects
  - most important data points
  - Provide a sense of depth and scale to the project, which can be used to guide where the majority of your time should be spent working on the project.

- Describe your dataset
  * Show a clear connection between the datasets and the problem presented. The project should avoid working with independent variables (or features) that would not ordinarily be available in order to predict your target.

- Explain your domain-level experience:
  - explain what existing knowledge you have about the topic
  - identify and evaluate other research methods that exist

- Identify project concerns in the form of risks and assumptions:
  - Discuss questions you need to have answered to do this well
  - Identify data points you don't have access to that would help you
  - Outline assumptions of your dataset
  - Explain the cost of your model being wrong
  - Identify inaccurate data or data that could be corrected

- Predict your project outcome:
  - What do you expect the output to look like?
  - What does your target audience expect the output to look like?
  - What gain do you expect from your most important feature on its own?
  - How complicated does your model have to be?
  - How successful does your project have to be in order to be considered a "success"?
  - What will you do if the project is a bust (this happens! but it shouldn't here)?




**Bonus:**

- Consider other hypotheses: if your project is a regression problem, is it possible to rewrite it as a classification problem?
- You can "convert" your goal metric from a statistical one (like Mean Squared Error) and tie it to something non-data people can understand, like a cost/benefit analysis

#### Necessary Deliverables

Using the template provided, your overview of approach will include:

* A more complete project problem and hypothesis based on your lightning talk
* Detailed explanation of data available (a data dictionary being the most specific approach; links to already built data dictionaries okay)
* Outstanding questions, assumptions, risks, caveats
* Domain knowledge included, knowledge about previous efforts/work. Including a benchmark if there is one
* Explaining what a success looks like

#### Starter code

Please use the [template](01-template.md) provided.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- The more time you spend researching, the less time you'll likely spend writing; this is a positive sign!
- While researching, keep track of all of your resources. Make sure they're trustworthy.
- If you've seen similar work online, see if you can find the code that implemented the data munging. It might come in handy!
- If your project requires using an API, make sure you can get access to it. Not everyone gives away API keys immediately, and you don't want to be caught with no data with one week left to work!

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Base on the requirements you can earn a maximum of _____ points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
