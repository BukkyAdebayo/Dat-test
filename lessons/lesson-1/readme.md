# Welcome to Data Science 

### Objectives
*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

- Describe the roles of GA staff and students to create a successful learning environment for data science 
- Define data science and the data science workflow
- Apply data science workflow to get to know the class
- Setup your data sceience development environment

### Preparation
*Before this lesson, students should already be able to:*

- TBD- Match these to the goals of the pre-work 


## Welcome to GA! - Intro (20 mins)

#### GA is a special learning environment 
- Introduce the instructors, EIRs, Producers
- GA is a global community of individuals empowered to persure the work we love.
- GA Resources- discounts, community events, hub, office hours
- GA feedback loop- exit tickets, mid-course feedback, final feedback

#### Road to Success 
- Emotional cycle of change
- Student learning responsiblity 
- GA graduation requirements
- After GA- build network, find oppurtunities, community, perks
- Q/A


## What is Data Science/ML- Intro (10 mins)
- A set of tools and techniques used to extract useful informaiton from data
- A interdisciplinary, problem-solving oriented subject
- Application of scientific techniques to practical problems

## Who uses Data Science- Think/Pair/Share (10 mins)
- Name three examples of data science being used. 
 

## Data Science Work Flow - Introduction (20 mins)
#### IDENTIFY: Understand the problem
- Identify business/product objectives 
- Identify and hypothesize goals and criteria for success 
- Create a set of questions for identifying correct data set

#### ACQUIRE: Obtain the data
- Identifying the “right” data set(s)
- Is there enough data?
- Does it appropriately align with the question/problem statement?
- Can the dataset be trusted?  How was it collected?
- Is this dataset aggregated? Can we use the aggregation or do we need to get it pre-aggregation?
- Assess resources, requirements, assumptions, and constraints 
- Import data from the web (Google Analytics, HTML, XML)
- Import data from a file (CSV, XML, TXT, JSON)
- Import data from a preexisting database (SQL)
- Set up local or remote data structure 
- Determine most appropriate tools to work with data 
- Tool follows the format, size of the dataset 

#### PARSE: Understand the data
- Read any documentation provided with the data
- Perform exploratory surface analysis via filtering, sorting, and simple visualizations 
- Describe data structure and the information being collected
- Explore variables, data types via select 
- Assess preliminary outliers, trends 
- Verify the quality of the data (feedback loop -> 1)

#### MINE: Prepare, structure, and clean the data 
- Sample the data, determine sampling methodology 
- Iterate and explore outliers, null values via select 
- Intro qualitative vs quantitative data
- Format and clean data in Python (dates, number signs, formatting)
- Define how to appropriately address missing values (cleaning)
- Categorization, manipulation, slicing, format, integrate data
- Format and combining different data points, separate columns, etc. 
- Determine most appropriate aggregations, cleaning, etc. methods
- Create necessary derived columns from the data (new data)

#### REFINE: Exploratory data analysis 
- Identify trends and outliers
- Decide how to deal with outliers - excluding, filtering, and communication
- Apply descriptive and inferential statistics
- Determine initial visualization techniques
- Document and capture knowledge
- Choose visualization techniques for different data types
- Transform data

#### BUILD: Create a data model
- Select appropriate model 
- Build model
- Evaluate and refine model
- Predict outcomes, action items 

#### PRESENT: Communicate the results of your analysis  
- Summarize findings with narrative, storytelling techniques 
- Refine visualization for broader comprehension
- Present limitations, assumptions
- Determine degree of disclosure /integrity of analysis
- What should I disclose to stakeholders as part of your analysis?
- Concrete steps for testing evaluating the effectiveness of your presen

#### Iteration / visualization
- Identify follow up problems and questions for future analysis
- Create a visually effective summary / report
- Consider different stakeholders, their needs, and how your report might change
- Identify the limitations of your analysis
- Identify relationships between visualizations

## Short version Data Science Work Flow- Application (30 mins)
Using three of the data science work flow steps (identify, acquire, present) we will get to know the class. 

Divide students to into 4 groups- spaced at the whiteboards around the room. 

#### IDENTIFY: Understand the problem (5 min)
Have each group develop 1 research question that they would like to know about the class and make a hypothesis (don't share with class yet)
Examples: 
Current favorite tool for working with data? 
What can you help your classmates with when it comes to data analysis? 
What you most excited about learning?

#### ACQUIRE: Obtain the data (10 min)
Have students rotate through the groups to "collect the data" (suggest students make a easy visual way for the other students to write their answers, or select an option quickly to keep the time on this down)
Record raw data on white boards.

#### PRESENT: Communicate the results of your analysis(15 min)  
- Summarize findings with narrative
- Provide a basic visualization for broader comprehension on white board
- Have one student present for the group


## Dev environment setup (60 min)
#### Brief intro to the tools we will use as a data sciencist- (detailed overview in lesson 2) 
#### Workshop to help with environment set up 

## Conclusion (5 mins)
- What is data science?
- What is the data science workflow?
- How can you have a successfull learning experience at GA?
